- 👋 Hi, I’m Long, known online as LongCT_. I am a software engineering student who mainly work on personal or for-fun projects.
- 👀 I’m interested in Minecraft modding, algorithms and generally, just programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different languages, mainly C# and Kotlin. I know how to code in Java, Python, a bit in C++, and very little Lua.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really.
- 📫 You can find me on Discord as LongCT_#8874, or my Twitter on my bio. Note that my Twitter is for Yugioh-related things only, and likely nothing related to projects I'm working on.
